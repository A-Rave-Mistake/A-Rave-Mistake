ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m @FancySnacks**  
Iâ€™m a guy who really likes Computer Science. I'm interested in various topics: backend programming, 3D graphics, game dev/design, robotics and graphic design.  
  
I'm currently learning and getting good at Java but mostly I'm a hobbyist game deveoper with a mission to create abstract, artful and fun games.  
I mostly focus on creating low-spec games so everybody gets to play no matter their gear, and I'm also experimenting with retro graphics to unleash their full potential.  
I'm also a 3D modeller in my spare time and same as with game dev - I enjoy doing low poly art.

I'm interested in bettering my skills and gaining experience, whether it's by jobs, internships, community projects or collabs. Ask me ãƒ½à¼¼àºˆÙ„Íœàºˆà¼½ï¾‰
