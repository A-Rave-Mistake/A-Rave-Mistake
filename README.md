ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m @FancySnacks**  
Iâ€™m a guy who really likes Computer Science. I'm interested in various topics: backend programming, 3D graphics, game dev/design, robotics and graphic design.  
  
I'm currently learning Java and Python. I'm getting good at full stack web development but I'm also a hobbyist game deveoper with a mission to create abstract, artful and fun games.  
I mostly focus on creating low-spec games so everybody gets to play no matter their gear, and I'm also experimenting with retro graphics to unleash their full potential.  
And I'm 3D modeller too in my spare time and same as with game dev - I enjoy doing low poly art.
