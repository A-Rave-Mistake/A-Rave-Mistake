ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m @FancySnacks**  
Iâ€™m a guy who really likes Computer Science. I'm interested in various topics: programming, game dev/design, 3D graphics and graphic design.  
  
I'm currently learning Python. I'm getting good at full stack web development. You might also know me as an hobbyist game deveoper with a mission to create abstract, unusual and fun games.  
I mostly focus on creating low-spec games so everybody gets to play no matter their specs, and I'm also experimenting with retro graphics to unleash their full potential.

âž• I'm interested in bettering my skills and gaining experience, whether it's by jobs, internships, community projects or collabs.
